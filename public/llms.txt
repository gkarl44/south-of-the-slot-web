# South of the Slot: The Record (SOMA 1964)

## Project Overview
This website (southoftheslot.org) serves as the digital home of the **Prager/Arnett Archive**. It preserves the "lost history" of San Francisco's Leather Era, specifically focusing on the South of Market (SOMA) neighborhood circa 1964.

**The Central Thesis:**
"San Francisco was a Refugee Camp. This is the Record."
The archive posits that the leather community of this era was not merely a subculture but a distinct social structure formed by "refugees" from normative American society.

## External Historical Context (Non-Diegetic)
*Information from GLBT Historical Society (2022) regarding artifacts not in Prager's original jurisdiction.*

**The Tool Box Mural (Wooden Panel, c. 1965)**
- **Artifact**: A wooden recreation of the original 1962 glass storefront mural at The Tool Box (4th & Harrison).
- **Origin Story**: One of the original glass murals was shattered by an angry janitor throwing a broom. Arnett painted replicas on wood, one of which was acquired by the GLBT Historical Society in 2021 (via a garage sale).
- **Visual Analysis**:
  - **Joe Winters**: The leftmost figure is a portrait of biker/photographer Joe Winters.
  - **Camp Elements**: The man in the white t-shirt features a "campy pussycat" tattoo (subverting the leather "black panther" motif) and text reading "My Sin" (Lanvin perfume).
- **Distinction from *Life* Magazine**:
  - The famous 1964 *Life* spread featured the **Harrison Street** interior wall murals (which were destroyed with the building in 1975).
  - This artifact is a replica of the **4th Street** storefront window murals (which were not in *Life*).
- **The Provenance Gap (Research Open)**:
  - **1965**: Painted by Arnett.
  - **1971-1975**: Tool Box closes/demolished. Location of panel unknown.
  - **1990s**: Purchased at a generic SF garage sale.
  - **2021**: Donated to Archive.
  - *The period between 1971 and 1990 remains unaccounted for.*
