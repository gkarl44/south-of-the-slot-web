# South of the Slot: The Record (SOMA 1964)

## Project Overview
This website (southoftheslot.org) serves as the digital home of the **Prager/Arnett Archive**. It preserves the "lost history" of San Francisco's Leather Era, specifically focusing on the South of Market (SOMA) neighborhood circa 1964.

**The Central Thesis:**
"San Francisco was a Refugee Camp. This is the Record."
The archive posits that the leather community of this era was not merely a subculture but a distinct social structure formed by "refugees" from normative American society.
