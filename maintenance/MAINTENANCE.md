# Maintenance Log

| Issue / Context | Action Taken / Notes |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Chapter 1**: "But Prager..." Robert is the author. Obviously he should not be referring to himself. That should be true everywhere. | Created new styled page at /chapter-1 using CSS Modules to match site aesthetics. Fixed raw text display. (Jan 24, 2026) |
| **Main Page**: Folder 02 box Essays not done yet. Repeating chapter here does not make sense. Link to Substack is good, but that should be in folder 01 box, perhaps just below "The Biography" such as "On Substack", meaning you can view the chapters there. | |
| **Main Page**: What is the origin of the main page graphic and is Leather Works Union an actual previous business? | |
| **Bio**: Need to put a bio for Robert somewhere, archive bio is good. | |
| **Content**: Need to explain southoftheslot somewhere. | |
