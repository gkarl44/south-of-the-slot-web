# The Stud and the Age of Aquarius Parade (1970)

If the Tool Box was the "Church" of leather, **The Stud** was its "Freak Show." Opened in 1966 at 1535 Folsom Street, it was, according to poet **Thom Gunn**, the world’s first "Head Bar"—a place where the boundaries between the leather scene and the hippie drug culture dissolved completely.

Chuck Arnett was its unofficial court artist.

By 1970, Chuck had transformed. The shy dancer who once "didn't like to draw extra attention to himself" (according to Paul Coates) had become a flamboyant mystic. In Binder 10 (File 35), Paul notes the shift:

*"Chuck never used to care all that much about when his birthday was... That didn't come until later, during the 60s, when Chuck got 'into' Astrology in a very big way."*

He began to define himself by his chart: **Aquarius with Leo Rising and Moon in Sagittarius**. This wasn't just cocktail chatter; it was a new identity, replacing the "Bastard" and the "Refugee" with something cosmic.

### The Reversal of Roles

This confidence marked a turning point in his relationship with his old mentor, Paul Coates. In the early days in New York, Paul had been the guide. Now, in San Francisco, the dynamic flipped.

Prager captures this poignantly in Binder 10 (File 13):
*"Everything changed. Suddenly, Paul found himself looking to Chuck to tell him what to do, how to act and what he should wear. Their roles had reversed almost completely. The student and follower had become the leader and the teacher. The one who had faced life with amazement... now had all the answers and calm self-assurance that had once belonged to his friend."*

Chuck was now the authority. And in August 1970, he exercised that authority on a grand scale.

### The Parade

The event was called the **Age of Aquarius Parade**, scheduled for August 16, 1970.

Unlike the political marches that would follow in later decades, this parade was "anti-political." Prager, citing Hal from *Militant Homophiles on Parade*, writes:
*"It was not a Gay Pride Parade in the modern sense. It was a parade for a bunch of gay hippies like Chuck Arnett who lived South of Market... The only thing they were interested in was having fun, getting high on drugs, and having sex all the time."*

Chuck designed the poster. It was a visual manifesto of this new "Aquarian" age—blending the hard lines of the leather world with the swirling, psychedelic energy of the counter-culture.

Under the influence of the Stud, and the stars, Chuck Arnett had reached his zenith. He was no longer just painting the scene; he was leading the parade.
