# Potato Salad Days

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


In 1951, Chuck Arnett arrived in Manhattan. He was twenty-three years old, six feet tall, and possessed what everyone in the trade called "the body of a professional dancer"—lean, wiry, flat-stomached, and deceptively strong. He had come from the humidity of New Orleans to the concrete canyons of New York with a single ambition: to make his living on the stage.

It was at an audition that year that he met Paul Coates. Paul was a year older, a native New Yorker, and a veteran of the Navy who had seen the Pacific theater. To the wide-eyed arrival from the South, Paul seemed to hold the keys to the city. He was the sophisticated guide, the mentor who knew which books to read and how to navigate the intricate social codes of the city's gay underground.

"We met at an audition," Paul would later recall. "That's how it always started."

Their friendship became the defining relationship of Chuck’s early adulthood. It was a bond that shifted over time—starting with Paul as the leader and Chuck as the eager student, until years later, the roles would surprisingly reverse. But in those early "potato salad days"—so named for the cheap meals they subsisted on while waiting for a callback—they were equals in ambition if not in experience. They were both tall, both talented, and both chasing a dream that had a strict expiration date.

"You can count all the dancers in New York who are over thirty on one hand," an older gypsy had warned Chuck early on. "And still have a couple of fingers left over."

For five years, Chuck struggled. He took classes, he auditioned, he worked odd jobs. He was a "gypsy"—part of the transient tribe of chorus boys and ensemble dancers who moved from show to show, living out of suitcases and sublets. It wasn't until 1956 that he finally caught his big break. He auditioned for the National Ballet of Canada and, against the odds, he got the job.
