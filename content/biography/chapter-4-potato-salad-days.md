# Potato Salad Days

In 1951, Chuck Arnett arrived in Manhattan. He was twenty-three years old, and he had come to the "capital of the world" with a single, burning ambition: to be a dancer.

Prager captures the physicality of this moment with obsessive detail in his notes. Chuck was six feet tall and lean, but deceptively powerful. He had "thick muscular legs and flat, firm hard abdominal muscles." He possessed, in the parlance of the trade, "the body of a dancer."

*"No matter how many times Chuck heard people describe him this way,"* Prager writes in Binder 1, *"it still gave him a thrill of happiness and satisfaction. It meant he had been right all along when he made his decision to move to New York to pursue his career in dance. Another way to put the same thing would be to say that he had the fit, muscular body of a trained athlete. He was physically in peak condition, never better, as well as at the top of his game professionally."*

But New York in the 1950s was a grinder. For every "lucky break," there were a thousand broken dreams. Chuck had moved to Manhattan determined to make a name for himself, but "for many years all of his work didn't seem to be leading anyplace."

### The Audition

It was in this crucible of ambition and failure that he met **Paul Coates**.

Paul was a year older, a native New Yorker, and a Navy veteran. He was everything Chuck felt he wasn't: sophisticated, confident, and at home in the city's complex social web. They met, as so many did in that "Theatrical Gypsy" life, on the hardwood floor of a dance studio.

*"I met Chuck when we both went out to audition for the same dance part,"* Paul told Prager, speaking a full fifty years later in 2001. *"But I want to be clear about one thing. Chuck was always a much better dancer than I was. I'm sure he was by far the best dancer who showed up to audition that day. Chuck was capable of out-dancing a whole room of ambitious and talented young professional dancers."*

This meeting was the "Eternal Spontaneous Now"—a phrase Prager uses to describe moments that ripple outward through time. Paul Coates would become the "first and truest friend Chuck ever had." He was the Virgil to Chuck's Dante, guiding him through the circles of the New York gay underground.

### The Education of an Artist

Paul possessed an intellectual confidence that dazzled the boy from the "Deepest Part of the Deep South." While Chuck had the raw talent—the "body of a dancer"—Paul had the context. He knew the history of the art form; he knew literature; he knew how to navigate the coded world of pre-Stonewall gay life without shame.

In the early years, their dynamic was clear: Paul was the mentor, Chuck the student. They subsisted on what Prager calls "Potato Salad Days"—the lean years of cheap diners, shared sublets, and the constant hustle for the next gig.

*"Chuck came to an early conclusion that Paul was a genius,"* Prager notes in Binder 10. *"The other thing that really impressed him about Paul was how confident and self-assured he was. Part of this could be explained by the fact that Paul had been born and raised right there in New York City. This meant that all the culture and intellect that had Chuck feeling so intimidated and dazzled were things that Paul took for granted."*

But there was a vulnerability in Chuck that Paul recognized, too. Despite his "peak physical condition," Chuck was a man searching for an identity. Was he just a body to be cast in a chorus line? Or was there something else waiting to be released?

It would be five years before the break came. Five years of cattle calls, rejections, and "potato salad" dinners. Finally, in 1956, he auditioned for the **National Ballet of Canada**.

Against the odds—and perhaps proving Paul's assessment of his talent correct—he got the job. He was leaving the "poverty days" behind. But he was taking the lessons of Paul Coates with him.
