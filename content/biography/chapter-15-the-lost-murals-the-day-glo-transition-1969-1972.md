# The Lost Murals and the Day-Glo Transition (1969–1972)

As the 1960s bled into the 70s, the "Theology of the Fist" began to glow in the dark. The era of the simple tool box was over; the era of the chemically altered consciousness—and the physically altered body—had begun.

### Saturnalia and the Heightened Colors

This transition was heralded by the "Saturnalia" parties at The Stud. The first, titled "Fire & Ice," took place on December 17, 1968. It was a deliberate attempt to fuse the leather aesthetic with the psychedelic experience. Chuck Arnett served as the set designer for this new reality, creating environments that were ecstatic, pagan, and drenched in artificial light.

According to poet Thom Gunn, the Stud during this period was unique—not just a "leather bar" like the Tool Box or the Detour, but the world's first "Head Bar." The visual language reflected this. Chuck began experimenting with fluorescent paints—Day-Glo pinks, electric blues, toxic greens—that reacted to the black lights of the clubs. He designed costumes for the Dance Spectrum’s production of *Kromatika*, literally a ballet of color. The rigid, black-and-white masculinity of the earlier leather scene was fracturing into something more fluid and hallucinogenic.

### The Taos Exile and the Needle in the Sky

However, this intensity came with a cost. In April 1969, a letter places Chuck in **Taos, New Mexico**, writing to Paul Coates on Easter Sunday. It was a brief exile, a "fugue state" in the desert. Prager refers to this as the beginning of the "Lost Murals" period, where Chuck's art became transient, painted on surfaces that would not survive.

By August 1970, Chuck had traveled even further, landing in Manhattan. He was commissioned to paint a mural at the **Eagle's Nest** on 11th Avenue in Chelsea. It was here that his darker visions began to manifest openly. Bill Tellman recalls Chuck describing his vision for the mural: he saw the **Empire State Building as a giant hypodermic needle**, injecting the city with a new, dark energy.

It was in this New York mural that Chuck first explicitly depicted "fistfucking" in a work of public art. As noted in the archives (*Binder 12, File 45*), he suggested the act within the mural's imagery, foreshadowing the hardcore "fist" iconography he would later cement with the Red Star Saloon poster.

### The Home of the Elbowriders

Returning to San Francisco, the scene had shifted. The "Family" was migrating from the communal playfulness of the Stud to darker, harder venues.

In January 1972, Chuck—along with Jason, Paul Feola, Kerry toles, and Mike Caffee—began working at the **No Name Bar** (formerly the Cow Palace Saloon) at 1351 Folsom. Chuck immediately set about transforming the space. He took a ceiling beam that had been carved with the slogan "Home of the Rough Riders" (a reference to a defunct western club) and altered it.

The new inscription proudly proclaimed: **"HOME OF THE ELBOWRIDERS."**

This was more than a pun; it was a declaration of a specific sexual practice moving from the underground into the semi-public sphere of the bar culture. Mister Marcus, writing in his column on February 15, 1972, noted: *"You can always tell Chuck Arnett has been at work... likewise, Chic O'Frisco and the fantastic Western murals at Fe-Be's."*

But while Chic O'Frisco was painting cowboys, Chuck was painting the physiological frontiers of the new sex.

### The Barracks and the Institutionalization of Instinct

On May 22, 1972, the **Barracks** opened. This was not just a bar; it was a "sex club," a prototype for the South of Market institutions that would follow (The Slot, The Catacombs). The Barracks represented the institutionalization of the impulses Chuck had been visualizing.

Chuck, Kerry, and Keith worked at the Barracks, embedding themselves in the infrastructure of the scene. Mike Caffee worked the front desk and created art for "Room 119." The "Family" was no longer just living the lifestyle; they were building the stage upon which it would be enacted for the thousands of men pouring into San Francisco.

These years, 1969–1972, were the bridge. They connected the "Head Bar" psychedelia of the Saturnalia parties to the grim, industrial, "Elbowrider" reality of the mid-70s. Chuck Arnett's murals were the signage for this bridge, pointing the way deeper into the dark.
