# Editor's Note: The Prager Archive Project

### A Collaboration Across Time

This biography is an **original work**, inspired by the lifelong research of **Robert Prager (1951–2014)**.

Prager, a San Francisco historian, spent the final two decades of his life obsessively documenting the "Golden Age" of the South of Market leather scene. He left behind a massive, labyrinthine collection of materials: over 120 digital floppy disks, thousands of pages of handwritten notes, and hundreds of partial drafts.

While Prager never completed his definitive manuscript, his archive contains the DNA of the story.

### Methodology

The text you are reading is a synthesis. It uses Prager's extensive chronologies, transcribed interviews, and draft fragments as its bedrock. Where Prager speaks directly—with his distinct, pugnacious wit—his voice is preserved and cited. Where gaps existed, the narrative has been constructed to connect the dots found in his archive.

It is a collaboration across time: Prager gathered the wood; we have built the house.

The result is a narrative that honors Prager's intent while acknowledging the interpretative work required to bring his vision to completion. It is not just a restoration; it is a resurrection of a story that was almost lost twice: first by the "historical amnesia" of the city, and second by the death of its chronicler.

### Archival Sources

The original physical materials for this project are housed in two California institutions:

1.  **ONE National Gay & Lesbian Archives at the USC Libraries**
    *   *Collection*: Robert Prager Collection
    *   *ID*: **Coll2014-033**
    *   *Location*: Los Angeles, CA
    *   [View Collection Guide](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c85h7k6c/)

2.  **The GLBT Historical Society**
    *   *Collection*: Robert Prager Papers
    *   *ID*: **2003-12**
    *   *Location*: San Francisco, CA

This digital project—*South of the Slot*—serves as a narrative key to those physical boxes, unlocking the stories contained within the papers.

### A Note on Citations
Throughout the text, you may see references to specific sources (e.g., "Binder 10a"). These numberings reflect the **digitization process** conducted by the editors during the rescue of the materials, rather than the official finding aid numbers of the physical archives. They serve to link the narrative back to the raw digital scans available in the "Evidence Room" of this site.
