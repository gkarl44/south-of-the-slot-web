# The Chicago Education: The Black Castle and Etienne (1961)

The *Bye Bye Birdie* tour brought Chuck Arnett to Chicago, a city that Prager describes as tougher and more elemental than the "glittering canyons" of New York. It was here, in the winter of 1961, that Chuck’s education truly began.

It started, as things often did for Chuck, with sex.

*"People he was introduced to in Chicago began as people he originally connected to through sex,"* Prager notes in Binder 11. *"He had tricked with a handsome sexy young guy named Cliff Ingraham in Chicago."*

Cliff lived in an apartment building that the locals—and its residents—jokingly called **"The Black Castle."**

### The Black Castle Context

The Black Castle wasn't just a grim dwelling; it was an incubator. It housed a collection of men who were quietly dismantling the rules of gay life. **Chuck Renslow**, the entrepreneur who owned the world's first leather bar, lived there. So did **Samuel Steward**, the university professor who moonlit as the tattoo artist "Phil Sparrow."

*"It was an experiment in group living,"* Prager writes, *"of creating a new kind of family for gay men."*

For Chuck, who had grown up with the "bastard" stigma and the "refugee" mentality, this was a revelation. Here was a domestic space that wasn't mimicking heterosexual marriage, but reinventing brotherhood.

### Meeting Etienne

But the most critical resident of the Black Castle for Chuck was a "very short Filipino guy named **Dom Orejudos**."

Like Chuck, Dom was a dancer (he would later perform with the Oakland Ballet). But more importantly, Dom was an artist who was just beginning to establish himself under the pseudonym **Etienne**.

*"The reason meeting him was important for Chuck's life is that Dom was also an artist,"* Prager emphasizes. *"At the time Chuck was in Chicago with Bye Bye Birdie, Dom was busy painting a mural on the walls of the Gold Coast."*

The **Gold Coast** was Renslow’s bar, the flagship of the American leather scene. Dom was covering its walls with images of leather men—hyper-masculine, idealized, and iconic. Chuck watched him work with "great interest."

Then came the invitation that changed everything.

*"Dom recruited Chuck to help paint in some of the mural for him. Chuck had never painted on anything close to this expansive level before. Most of his paintings had always been conventional in terms of their size. They were suitable for hanging on the living room walls of a middle class 3 bedroom home."*

### The New Scale

This moment—brush in hand, standing before the wall of a leather bar—was the hinge of Chuck Arnett's career. He realized that art didn't have to be polite. It didn't have to be framed. It could be **environmental**. It could surround the viewer, creating a feedback loop between the men in the painting and the men in the bar.

*"Clearly, working with Dom on this must have started Chuck's imagination off onto new lines,"* Prager speculates, *"subconsciously preparing him for painting his own mural at the Tool Box just over a year later."*

When the tour bus left Chicago, Chuck Arnett was still a chorus boy. But in his mind, he was already something else. He had seen the Black Castle. He had touched the walls of the Gold Coast. He was ready for San Francisco.
