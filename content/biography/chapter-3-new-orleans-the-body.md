# New Orleans: The Body

If Chuck was born in the shadows of Bogalusa, his spirit was forged in the humid, secretive heat of New Orleans. By 1940, at the age of twelve, the patterns of his life were already beginning to take shape.

His mother, Hazel, was a woman of her own wild spirit. There is a surviving snapshot of her from this era, riding on the back of a boyfriend’s motorcycle, wind in her hair, looking every bit the outlaw’s companion. It was a foreshadowing of the leather culture Chuck would later define—he didn't just invent the biker aesthetic; he inherited it.

It was around this time that he discovered the illicit thrill of "T-room" sex. In the privacy of public restrooms in Audubon Park and along the dimmer streets of the French Quarter, he found a community of men seeking what he sought: the silent, urgent connection of bodies. It was his initiation into a hidden world that came complete with its "elaborate rituals of invitation, seduction and response." Soon he knew the location of every T-room in the city; it was a genesis, a first step into a life that would always prioritize the raw truth of desire over social niceties.

But there was another side to the young Charles Arnett, one that sought the spotlight rather than the shadows. He discovered ballet.

In the late 1940s, New Orleans was experiencing a cultural bloom under the guidance of **Lelia Haller** and the New Orleans Recreation Department (NORD). None of the local institutions approached the "standards attained by Lelia Haller's corps de ballet," whose line of precision dancers were the talk of the town. Chuck threw himself into this world with the same obsessive intensity he brought to everything else. He didn't just want to dance; he wanted to perform. He wanted to be *seen*.

By 1948, he was a regular in Haller’s productions. In April of that year, he led the dancers in Barber's *Capricorn Concerto*. In June, he shared the stage with the legendary Igor Youskevitch in *Marpessa*, playing the role of the King. The local press took notice. Columnist Carter Stevens wrote that Arnett "endowed that role with both humor and fine rhythm."

His breakout came in 1949 with the production of *Petrouchka*. Playing the role of the Moor—a character of passion and jealousy—Chuck found a vehicle for his dramatic intensity. "Charles Arnett's Moor was thoroughly successful within its range," noted one critic. Another, Ed Brooks of the *Times-Picayune*, went further: "Charles Arnett, in his first major role, was right up with them."

He was building the "body of a professional dancer"—lean, fit, limber. He was learning how to hold an audience, how to move, how to control space. But he was also learning that New Orleans, for all its charms, was too small to hold him. The "Deepest Part of the Deep South" was the starting line, not the finish.

In 1951, he packed his bags for New York City. He was leaving behind the "Junior" and the T-rooms of home for the bright lights of Manhattan. He was going to be a star.
