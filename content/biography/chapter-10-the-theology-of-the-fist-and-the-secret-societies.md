# The Theology of the Fist and the Secret Societies

If the early 60s were about "Arrival," the mid-60s were about "Revelation."

Prager ties this psychological shift to the concept of the mask. In his notes on Mardi Gras (where Chuck grew up), he writes:
*"People donned the most outlandish costumes, not to disguise themselves so much as to **reveal the secret identity long hidden deep within them**... they were liberated to act in an outrageous manner, performing acts... too respectable or imprudent to engage in at any other time of the year."*

In San Francisco, this "Mardi Gras" didn't last a week. It lasted all year. And the costume wasn't sequins; it was leather.

### The Secret Societies

By 1965, the leather scene began to stratify. It wasn't enough to just look the part at the Tool Box. There were deeper levels of commitment. Prager identifies the rise of what he calls "Secret Societies"—insular, semi-clandestine groups dedicated to exploring the extremes of gay sexuality.

Chief among these was the **FFA** (Fist Fuckers of America).

The name was a provocation, often euphemized in public as "The Final Faith of America." But to its members, it was a brotherhood. Prager argues that for men like Chuck, these acts weren't just sexual; they were theological. They involved rituals of endurance, trust, and transcendence that mirrored religious ecstasy. The "Catacombs"—dark, private basements in SOMA—became their chapels.

### The Evolution of the Art

Chuck's art began to reflect this new theology. The static, standing figures of the Tool Box mural gave way to more complex, tangled compositions. He began to depict the specific acts of the "Faith"—the fisting, the bondage, the total submission.

But he was also perfecting his own "Secret Identity." Binder 10 captures a description of the quintessential Arnett look from this era (often attributed to Thom Gunn or Chuck himself):

*"He was wearing his tall black leather boots, the ones that went up almost to his knee. I also remember noting that he had on a pair of nicely fitting leather pants—as opposed to the more traditional motorcycle chaps. His black leather motorcycle jacket was open to reveal that he was also wearing a leather harness. Gauntlets on his forearms and a cap perched at a rakish angle on top of his head..."*

He looked like a comic book hero—or villain. He had become the Avatar of the lifestyle he painted.
