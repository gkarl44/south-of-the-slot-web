# The Theology of the Fist & The Secret Societies

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


But Chuck's transformation wasn't limited to public art. In the private, smoke-filled rooms of the after-hours scene, he was undergoing a conversion of a different kind.

It was Jack Haines—a man who ran a company called "Bay Gas and Pipe" before opening his own leather bars—who introduced Chuck to the practice that would become his spiritual obsession: **fistfucking**.

In his ambitious, unfinished essay *"The Annals of Fistfucking,"* Prager attempts to situate this practice not merely as a sexual act, but as a defining cultural rupture. He notes that researchers from anthropology to sexology have reached a "consensus that fistfucking literally has no history." There are no medical records from the 19th century, no mention in the Victorian underground diaries, no transcripts in criminal courts.

"The complete lack of evidence is overwhelming," Prager wrote. "Fistfucking is of very recent, almost contemporary origins, an invention of the 20th Century."

This didn't stop a wave of what Prager termed **"Pseudo-Historicism"** in the 1970s. As the practice moved from the shadows to the "semi-public private" of the sex clubs, its new adherents sought to legitimize it by inventing an ancient lineage. They pointed to scenes in the film *Caligula* or rumored "Greek vases" depicting fisting. Prager debunked these meticulously: the *Caligula* scenes were inspired by the actors' nights in New York leather bars, not Roman history, and the "Greek" vases were actually 1970s commissions painted in an "Attic style" for Peter Larkin’s book *The Divine Androgyne*.

For Chuck Arnett, the lack of history was the point. They were not repeating the past; they were pioneering the future.

He watched, mesmerized and terrified, as Jack Haines demonstrated the act at a private party. It seemed physically impossible. He watched the fingers disappear, then the palm, then the wrist, and finally the forearm, sliding deep into the body of another man. The recipient didn't scream in pain; he moaned in a state of transcendent bliss.

To Chuck, this wasn't just extreme sex. It was "Butt Hole Wisdom." It was a **gnosis**—a secret knowledge that could only be accessed by pushing the body beyond its perceived limits. It required total trust, total relaxation, and a total surrender of control.

"You have to open up," Chuck would later tell his "disciples," sounding less like a pornographer and more like a Zen master. "You have to let go of everything you think you are."

Prager identified a "democratic" radicalism in the act. Unlike traditional intercourse, which is biologically defined by gender roles (the penetrator vs. the penetrated), fisting was purely voluntary. "The sex roles," Prager argued, "are determined almost entirely on the willingness of each party to perform the role in question." It was the "most democratic of all possible sexual practices," a space where a man could be a husband, a biker, or a lawyer by day, and a total vessel by night.

Around this practice, a series of "secret societies" sprang up, with acronyms that were half-joke, half-code. There was **T.A.I.L.** (The Total Anal Involvement League) and **M.A.F.I.A.** (Mid-American Fists In Action). Clubs like **The Barracks**, **The Slot**, and **The Catacombs**—a name that deliberately invoked the persecuted Christians of ancient Rome—became their temples.

It was a scene that touched everyone, even the future icons of the movement. Biographer Randy Shilts would later confirm that **Harvey Milk** himself was an initiate, and his partner Scott Smith remained a fixture of the fisting scene long after Milk's assassination. Even the gender lines were blurred in these secret rooms; at *The Catacombs*, it was rumored that lesbians would sometimes join the fray, fisting the men and being fisted in return, proving that the "Theology of the Fist" transcended even gender.

For Chuck, a man who had spent his life disciplining his body for dance, this was the ultimate performance. But unlike dance, which was about projection and ego, fisting was about reception and negation. It was the "Deepest Part" of himself he had been searching for since Bogalusa—a place where he could finally be completely, terrifyingly open.

He became a proselytizer for the practice, viewing it not as a perversion but as a high art. "A stiff dick knows no conscience," he would say, quoting the biological imperative, but in fisting, he found a consciousness that transcended the phallic. He sketched it, he talked about it, and eventually, in the famous *Red Star* poster, he would enshrine it as the central sacrament of the leather church.
