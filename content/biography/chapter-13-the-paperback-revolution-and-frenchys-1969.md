# The Paperback Revolution and Frenchy's (1969)

By 1969, the "Theology of the Fist" had found a new, mass-market bible.

It began on the shelves of **Frenchy's Adult Books**, a downtown San Francisco institution that decided, in the words of a contemporary report, "to enter into the book publishing business."

Prager devotes extensive space in Binder 17 to tracking this moment. He cites a review by **Charles McAllister** in *The Scene* magazine (January 1969), who noted that Frenchy's was bringing out "their own series of quality new gay fiction" under the rubric of **"Frenchy's Gay Line."**

The inaugural title was **Dirk Vanden's** novel *I Want It All*.

Prager contrasts the reception of this book with the snobbery of the time. While *The Advocate* dismissed it as "trash," Charles McAllister hailed it as a breakthrough: *"It is his best work and tells almost all there is to know about the bike set. (The setting is San Francisco's Folsom Street bars)."*

### The Artist of the Pulp

This explosion of print culture—"The Paper Revolution"—needed imagery. The publishers needed covers that signaled to the initiated exactly what kind of fantasy lay inside.

Chuck Arnett became their illustrator of choice.

His style was perfect for the medium. Unlike the highly polished, almost campy physiques of Tom of Finland, Arnett's figures were "gritty, anatomical, and tangled." They looked like the men in the bars. They looked like the men in the "catacombs."

He illustrated for *Spartacus*, the international gay guide which spread his "SOMA look" to Europe. He did covers for the flood of titles coming out of **Greenleaf Classics** (publishers of *Song of the Loon*).

In doing so, Chuck Arnett achieved a level of ubiquity that no mural could match. A mural is fixed in space; you have to go to the Tool Box to see it. A paperback is a virus. It travels in suitcases, it gets passed hand-to-hand in bus stations, it lives under mattresses in small towns.

Through these "trashy" novels, the aesthetic of the San Francisco leather scene—the aesthetic Chuck had codified—conquered the gay imagination of America.
