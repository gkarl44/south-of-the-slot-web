# The Ambush Years, Mellow Men, and the Employee Lounge (1975–1980)

From the mid-70s onward, Chuck Arnett’s world shrank. The frenetic energy of the "Age of Aquarius" and the hard edge of the "Elbowriders" softened into the chemical haze of the mid-70s. His address changed, but his true home was always the same: **The Ambush**.

### The Mellow Men

The Ambush cultivated a different vibe from the raw sex clubs like the Barracks. Mister Marcus, the chronicler of the scene, captured this shift in a column dated March 6, 1975: *"The mellow David, Kerry and Ken of The Ambush are sailing along on a very pleasant trip with decor by the fabulous Chuck Arnett stimulating those of you who seek diversion(s) other than crowded and wild bars."*

These were the "Mellow Men"—David, Kerry Bowman, and later Ken Fitzharris. They represented a scene that was settling down, becoming comfortable in its own skin. Chuck was central to this. On March 15, 1976, he officially began working at the Ambush as a bartender. The artist had become the host.

### Ruins and Rebirth

But the past was always present. In April 1975, a poignant photograph was taken: **Aaron Caffee**, the infant son of Chuck's longtime friend Mike Caffee, was photographed in front of the ruins of the Tool Box. The bar that had started it all was now rubble, half-demolished. The image of the baby against the wreckage underscored the passage of time—a cycle of destruction and new life that Chuck, now entering his late 40s, was acutely aware of.

### The Employee Lounge Controversy

Inside the Ambush, there was a sanctuary known as the **Employee Lounge**. It was here that Chuck held court.

In 1985, a minor controversy erupted in the pages of the *Bay Area Reporter* regarding Chuck's work. On January 10, Mister Marcus reported that a "copy of the famous Chuck Arnett mural" would grace the employee lounge of a bar called Chaps.

Three weeks later, on January 31, Marcus issued a correction, addressing Ambush owner Ken Fitzharris directly: *"The Chuck Arnett copy of the Tool Box mural is going to the employee lounge at the Ambush and not at the location previously mentioned, right Ken Fitzharris?"*

Prager contends this was not a "copy." It was a continuation. Even as his physical world contracted to the size of a staff room, Chuck continued to paint his signature men—leather-clad, stoic, eternal. The mural wasn't for the world anymore; it was for the insiders. It was art for the people who stayed after the bar closed.
