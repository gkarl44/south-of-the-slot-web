# Murals and Motorcycles

By 1968, the geography of SOMA was changing. The Tool Box was no longer the only game in town. New bars were opening—**Febe's**, **The Ramrod**, **The Detour**, **The 888**.

And wherever there was a new wall, there was Chuck Arnett.

Prager’s interview with the poet **Thom Gunn** (Binder 11a, File 17) provides a chaotic, firsthand account of this expansion. Thom recalls:

*"The Ramrod opened in 1968... But you're forgetting all about the 888, which was very nice. It was on McAllister Street and it was started by a man called Ralph... He was the owner but he had the sense to employ Chuck Arnett and Bill Tellman and to put up some wonderful decorations."*

Even in this "wonderful" period, the rivalries were fierce. Thom recounts a legendary incident at the Detour involving **Chic O'Frisco**, another prominent bar decorator known for his "white leather" aesthetic.

*"That's where Chuck Arnett stomped on Chic O'Frisco's poppers,"* Thom laughs. *"‘Oh, you must have dropped these. How dreadful. How very dreadful.’"*

Prager clarifies the context: *"Chic O'Frisco was Chuck Arnett’s competition. In one of his columns Marcus called Chuck Arnett and Chic O’Frisco the two most talented decorators at work in the south of Market bars. They were rivals."*

### The King on a Bike

It was also during this period that the motorcycle became an inextricable part of the Arnett mythos.

Prager notes in the Gmail archive that Chuck bought his first bike while briefly in Las Vegas. He let a salesman talk him into a "cheaper Japanese model," a detail that haunted him but didn't stop him from riding it like a King.

The bike allowed him to move between his various "courts"—the bars he decorated, the after-hours parties on Pierce Street, and the private studios where he worked. He was a mobile monarch, clad in the "Chippewa boots" and "open jacket" that defined the era.
