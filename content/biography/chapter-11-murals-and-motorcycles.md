By the mid-60s, Chuck Arnett was no longer just the man who painted the *Tool Box*; he was the visual architect of the entire scene.

He moved his talents to a new generation of bars, each with a distinct character. At *The Detour*, located at 15th and Folsom, he created something radically different from his earlier work. Instead of the brooding, realistic giants of the *Tool Box*, he painted a pop-art masterpiece of traffic signs. It was a visual pun—*The Detour*—perfect for a bar that served as a transition point for men navigating the labyrinth of the night. The walls were covered in arrows, yield signs, and "WRONG WAY" warnings, turning the bar into a disorienting, exciting maze.

But his influence extended beyond the gay world. Chuck became a living bridge between the "leather men" of Folsom Street and the "straight" outlaw biker gangs, most notably the *Warlocks*.

In a move that terrified and fascinated his friends, Chuck became a "Buddy Rider" for the club. He didn't ride his own bike; he rode "bitch" on the back of a Warlock's Harley. He attended their parties, navigating the hyper-masculine, sometimes violent world of the 1%ers with the same chameleon-like adaptability that had served him in the ballet.

Jim Jann, a Warlock photographer who documented the scene, recalled Chuck's unique position in the club. "He was an honorary Warlock," Jann told Prager while flipping through old black-and-white contact sheets. "We called him... what's that guy who was in the musical that got around with an umbrella and made magic?"

It wasn't just parties. Chuck participated in the "Runs"—motorcycle convoys that roared out of the city to destinations like Juanita's restaurant in Sausalito or Crockett. "Juanita! Did you ever hear of Juanita?" Jann asked. "She ran restaurants in South San Francisco and Sausalito... We had a run to her place."

One event in particular cemented this bond: the **Warlock Party of November 1966**. As Jann recalled ("That's when they threw the big party for us"), it was a moment where the lines between the gay leather scene and the straight outlaw world blurred completely. Chuck was the conduit. He sketched them, he drank with them, and he brought their aesthetic back to the gay bars. The chains, the colors, the specific cut of the denim vests—Chuck was the medium through which the "outlaw look" traveled from the straight world to the gay one.

He wasn't alone in shaping this aesthetic. He found a kindred spirit in Mike Caffee, a sculptor who created the iconic statue for *Fe-Be's*. Together, they defined the look of Folsom Street—a mix of classical masculinity and gritty, industrial toughness.
