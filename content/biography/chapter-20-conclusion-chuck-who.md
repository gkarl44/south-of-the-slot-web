# Conclusion: Chuck Who?

In a draft essay dated March 10, Robert Prager posed a question that would become the driving force of this entire project: **"Chuck Who?"**

He wrote: *"Chuck Arnett was once one of the biggest names in gay San Francisco. He was bigger than big. As big in his way as Harvey Milk would later be, as big as Sylvester James."*

But by the time Prager began his research in the late 1990s, the "King of South of Market" had become a rumor. While his contemporary, Tom of Finland, had a Foundation and an Institute dedicated to his legacy, Chuck Arnett had only fading photocopies and the memories of dying men.

### The Erasure

The erasure was swift. In 1989, just a year after Chuck's death, Jack Fritscher published a retrospective in *Drummer* magazine titled **"Artist Chuck Arnett: His Life/Our Times."** It was later reprinted in Mark Thompson's anthology *Leatherfolks* (1991). Yet, even this tribute was, in Prager's estimation, "short" and lacking in the "detailed information" required to understand the man's true scope.

The South of Market that Chuck had built—the "Refugee Camp" of the 60s, the "Elbowriders" clubs of the 70s—was being razed. The murals were painted over or demolished. The "historical amnesia" that Prager often railed against had set in, aided by the silencing power of the AIDS pandemic.

### The Restoration

"Who was Chuck Arnett?"

This archive—**The Prager Papers**—is the answer.

It reveals a man who was not just a "Leather Artist" but a pivotal figure in the cultural history of San Francisco. A man born in the "Deepest Part of the Deep South" (or, as we now know, Bogalusa) who rejected the "Old Homosexuality" of the closet and the "New Homosexuality" of the clone to forge something darker, harder, and more enduring.

He was the Saint in the Swamp. He was the Dancer who panicked at thirty-three. He was the Muralist of the Tool Box who envisioned the Empire State Building as a hypodermic needle. He was the "Just Dealer" selling speed from a hospital bed.

He was the creator of an aesthetic that defined a generation. And thanks to Robert Prager’s obsessive, messy, beautiful crusade, the question is no longer "Chuck Who?"

He is **Chuck Arnett**. And this is his life and times.
