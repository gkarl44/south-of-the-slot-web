# Arrival and Transformation

When Chuck Arnett moved to San Francisco permanently in 1962, the South of Market (SOMA) district was largely an industrial ghost town. It was a grid of warehouses, trucking depots, and cheap hotels that lived in a perpetual state of neglect.

To the civic planners of the era, SOMA was a blight. To Chuck Arnett and the men like him, it was a sanctuary.

In his notes, Prager returns again and again to a single text to explain this migration: **"Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto"** by Carl Wittman. Written in 1969, it captures the psychology of the men who arrived in the early 60s.

> *"San Francisco is a refugee camp for homosexuals,"* Wittman wrote. *"We have fled here from every part of the nation, and like refugees elsewhere, we came not because it is so great here, but because it was so bad there."*

Prager elaborates on this list of grievances in Binder 1: *"Some fled after being dishonorably discharged and drummed out of the military. Others came after being fired without just cause from their jobs. More of us came after being disowned and disinherited by their own families. Some of us fled to San Francisco after being threatened and taunted by bullies."*

Chuck was one of these refugees. He had fled the damp oppression of New Orleans, the commercial grind of New York, and the rigid schedule of the touring company. In SOMA, he found a place where the rules of "Amerika" didn't apply.

### The Miracle of the Fog

If the geography of SOMA was the stage, the weather was the curtain. Prager writes obsessively about the fog, describing it not just as a meteorological event, but as a protective entity.

*"Particles of fog were absorbed in the dust; beads of moisture formed on the bricks,"* he writes in a draft titled *Charles William Arnett Junior*. *"Pieces of lath shatter behind the boots of a guy wearing a cowboy hat as he walks through the wreckage. Time seems oddly frozen."*

This "frozen time" allowed for reinvention. Shielded by the fog and the crumbling brickwork, men could shed their "civilian" identities. The bank teller could put on a leather jacket. The chorus boy could put on motorcycle boots.

*"Our safety was in our sheer numbers,"* Prager quotes from the manifesto, *"and that is why we built us a ghetto, as a place of our own, where we might feel safer from public attack."*

For Chuck Arnett, this ghetto offered a new kind of canvas. He wasn't interested in painting "conventional art" anymore. He wanted to paint the fog, the wreckage, and the men who walked through it. He had found his subject. Now he just needed a wall.
