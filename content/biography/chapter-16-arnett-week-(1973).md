# Arnett Week (1973)

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


The year 1973 began quietly, but it would end with Chuck Arnett achieving a level of fame that few underground artists ever see. It was the year of "Arnett Week"—an event that proved, fleetingly, that the "King of South of Market" still wore his crown.

The festivities were announced by none other than Mister Marcus, the gossip columnist for the *Bay Area Reporter*, who told his readers: "If you haven't been into the Red Star [Saloon] lately, you'll freak... They'll be having a big art show of Chuck Arnett's works in three galleries and at THE STUD."

Marcus, ever the chronicler of the scene, noted that "you can always tell when Chuck Arnett has been busy." And he had been busy. The "Arnett Week" celebration (November 19–22) was a massive, coordinated retrospective of his work, sprawling across multiple venues.

It kicked off at *The Stud* on Folsom Street, where Chuck had once tended bar. On display was his famous Day-Glo mural, a psychedelic masterpiece that had defined the bar's aesthetic. The next day, the party moved to "David Barnard's No Gallery" on 11th Street for an exhibition of 33 new pieces. Then, to the *No Name* bar at 1347 Folsom—where Chuck had carved the legend "HOME OF THE ELBOWRIDERS" into a ceiling beam.

Finally, on Thanksgiving Day, the celebration culminated at the **Red Star Saloon** (1145 Folsom), a bar Chuck didn't just decorate—he managed it.

The *Red Star* was legendary. Gayle Rubin, the anthropologist and historian of the leather scene, affectionately called it "the sleaziest bar in the history of Folsom Street." It had a secret door on the upper floor that connected directly to *The Barracks* bathhouse, allowing naked, towel-clad men to descend into the bar like fallen angels.

It was here, in this "sleazy" cathedral, that Chuck debuted his most infamous work: the *Red Star* poster.

Primitive, shocking, and undeniably powerful, the poster depicted a man handcuffed to a toilet bowl, being sexually used by two other men. It was a scene straight out of the darkest backroom fantasies, rendered in stark black ink. But the detail that made it iconic—the Arnett touch—was the graffito scrawled on the toilet bowl in the drawing:

*"IF YOUR HEAVY ENOUGH"*

It was a challenge, a dare, and a philosophy all in one. The grammar was wrong ("Your" instead of "You're"), but the message was unmistakable. And the word "Heavy" carried a specific weight in 1973. It didn't mean physical mass; it was the "heavy" of the counterculture—as in "Heavy Leather," "Heavy Drugs," or "That's a heavy trip, man." It meant *intense*. It meant *profound*. It meant that you possessed a soul capable of withstanding the extreme experience being depicted.

The poster sold out in two days. It became an instant collector's item, hoarding by men who saw their own desires reflected on the wall. For a brief moment in 1973, Chuck Arnett wasn't just an artist; he was the toast of the town.
