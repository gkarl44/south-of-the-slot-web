# The Chicago Education: The Black Castle & Etienne (1961)

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


It was during the tour of *Bye Bye Birdie* in 1961 that Chuck found the missing link between his life as a dancer and his future as an artist. The company stopped in Chicago, a city with a thriving, if underground, leather scene.

Chuck fell in with a crowd centered around a legendary apartment building jokingly called **"The Black Castle."** The landlord was **Chuck Renslow**, the owner of the *Gold Coast*, the world's first true leather bar. Also living there was **Samuel Steward**, the university professor who secretly moonlit as the tattoo artist and erotic writer "Phil Andros."

But the most important meeting was with a short, Filipino dancer named **Dom Orejudos**. To the world, Dom was a ballet dancer with the Illinois Ballet. To the underground, he was becoming **Etienne**, the erotic artist who would define the look of leather sex for a generation.

At the time, Dom was painting a mural on the walls of the *Gold Coast*. He recruited Chuck—fellow dancer, fellow dyke—to help him fill in the details. It was Chuck's first experience painting on a "monumental scale." He had always been a "living room artist," sketching on small pads. Working with Dom, he learned how to command a room with paint, how to create a "mirror" for the men standing at the bar.

Clearly, working with Dom on this must have started Chuck’s imagination off onto new lines, subconsciously preparing him for painting his own mural at the Tool Box just over a year later.

When Chuck arrived in San Francisco, he wasn't just improvising. He was bringing the lessons of the *Gold Coast* to the West Coast.
