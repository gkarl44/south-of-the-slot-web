# On Tour and the Finocchio's Incident

In April 1958, the National Ballet of Canada arrived in San Francisco for a run at the **War Memorial Opera House**. For Chuck Arnett, now thirty years old, it was his first encounter with the city that would eventually consume him.

The tour was grueling, a blur of hotels and stages, but San Francisco was different. It had a reputation. It was a city that tolerated—even celebrated—eccentricity.

During their stay, the **Canadian Consul General**, a man named **Christopher Everts**, decided to extend a gesture of hospitality to the visiting troupe. He arranged a special night out for the dancers. And because this was San Francisco, and because he wanted to show them the "local color," he chose the most famous nightclub in the city: **Finocchio's**.

Located in North Beach, Finocchio's was world-renowned for its female impersonators. It was a tourist trap, a place where buses unloaded mid-westerners to gawk at men in drag. To the Consul General, it was harmless fun. To the closeted gay men of the National Ballet, it was a sanctioned, if slightly embarrassing, glimpse of their own world reflected in a funhouse mirror.

But when the invitation reached Chuck Arnett, he recoiled.

*"I don't go to places like that,"* Chuck told the Consul General, flatly refusing the invitation.

### The Old vs. The New

Prager identifies this moment as a critical fissure in gay history. Finocchio's represented the "Old Homosexuality"—the idea that to be gay was to be effeminate, to mimic women, to be a joke. It was the "swish" style that had dominated the underground for decades.

Chuck was looking for something else. He was looking for the "New Homosexuality"—a style that was masculine, serious, and rooted in the emerging aesthetic of the leather man. He didn't want to laugh at men in dresses; he wanted to find men who looked like the workers he saw on the docks or the bikers he saw on the highway.

So, while his colleagues went to Finocchio's to sip cocktails and watch the drag show, Chuck wandered off alone into the fog of North Beach.

He found himself in the beatnik bars and coffee houses of the neighborhood. Here, amidst the poets and the drifters, he saw a different kind of man. He saw men in "Levi’s and flannel shirts," men who wore their masculinity not as a costume but as a fact.

He felt an immediate kinship with these "drifters." They were outsiders, yes, but they weren't clowns.

Chuck would leave San Francisco when the tour moved on. He would return a year later, in 1959, dancing in the chorus of *Li'l Abner* at the **Curran Theater**. But the seed had been planted. He knew now that there was a place for him—not in the drag clubs of the "Old" world, but in the foggy streets of the "New."
