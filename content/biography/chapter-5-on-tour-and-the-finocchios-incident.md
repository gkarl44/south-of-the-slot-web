# On Tour & The Finocchio's Incident

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


Joining the National Ballet changed everything. Suddenly, Chuck wasn't just another struggling dancer in New York; he was a touring professional. The company traveled by train, a mobile village of artists moving across the North American continent. They played the big cities—Montreal, Toronto, Washington D.C.—and the secondary stops that blurred into a haze of hotel rooms and theaters.

The tour was relentless. They swept through the Southwest—Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Utah—before finally crossing the state line into California. They debuted at the Philharmonic in Los Angeles on March 31, 1958, then moved on to Long Beach, San Bernardino, Pasadena, and San Diego before looping back to L.A.

But the real destination, the place that would change Chuck's life, was San Francisco.

They arrived in early April 1958 to perform at the War Memorial Opera House. It was a venue that exceeded its reputation, with its imperial dome and decorative gargoyles speaking to a city that valued the arts with a deadly seriousness. They were met there by Christopher Everts, the Canadian Consul General, a man eager to show his country’s cultural ambassadors a good time.

Everts, playing the gracious host, made a special invitation to the male dancers. He was planning a night out at *Finocchio's*, the world-famous nightclub in North Beach where female impersonation had been elevated to a tourist attraction. He assumed the "boys" would appreciate the costumes, the camp, and the spectacle.

As Chuck stood listening to the diplomat, he knew he had absolutely no intention of going.

To Chuck, *Finocchio's* represented the "Old Homosexuality"—a world where gay men were expected to be delicate souls trapped in male bodies, expressing themselves through drag and effeminacy. Chuck was already looking for something else. He wasn't interested in men who wanted to be women; he was interested in men who wanted to be *men*. He wanted the "New Homosexuality"—masculine, rough, and unapologetic.

Instead of the drag club, Chuck headed for North Beach to find the Beatniks. He wanted to see the world of *Howl*, the coffee shops, and the "refugee camp" of artists and outlaws. He didn't know it yet, but he was already drifting away from the ballet and toward the leather.
