# The Turning Point

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.

On Friday, February 14, 1958—Valentine's Day—the National Ballet Company performed in College Park, Maryland. The next day, Saturday, February 15, was an official travel day. It was also the day Chuck Arnett turned thirty.

He spent the milestone sitting in a train car, watching the grey, frozen winterscape of Pennsylvania roll by outside the window. There is no record that he told anyone on the train it was his birthday. In the insular, youth-obsessed world of professional dance, turning thirty wasn't a celebration; it was a warning shot.

"You can count all of the dancers in New York who are over thirty on one hand," an older gypsy had warned him when he first arrived in Manhattan seven years earlier. "And probably still have a couple of fingers left over."

For seven years, Chuck had defied the odds. He had the "body of a professional dancer"—lean, wiry, with flat abdominal muscles and the endurance of an athlete. But sitting on that train, he knew the expiration date was looming. His oldest friend, Paul Coates, had already seen the writing on the wall and retired to teach dance at a finishing school in Shreveport, Louisiana. Now, Chuck faced the same precipice.

He wasn't a "pretty boy." His face was pitted with acne scars from his youth, giving him a rugged, almost dangerous look that choreographers didn't always know what to do with. He realized that the next act of his life wouldn't be on a proscenium stage.

He kept dancing for a few more years—touring with *Li'l Abner* in 1959 and *Bye Bye Birdie* in 1961, where he played a shriner and "The Conductor." But internally, he had already checked out. He was no longer a dancer waiting for a callback; he was a man waiting for a new identity.
