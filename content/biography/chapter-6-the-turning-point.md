# The Turning Point

In 1961, Chuck Arnett landed a spot in the chorus of the first national tour of **Bye Bye Birdie**. The show was a smash hit—a "thinly veiled spoof of the rise to fame by Elvis Presley"—and for a dancer, it was a steady paycheck. But for Chuck, now thirty-three years old, it was also a deadline.

Thirty-three is the "panic age" for a dancer. The body, once a reliable instrument, begins to whisper its limitations. The recovery times get longer; the knees ache a little more after the curtain falls.

"He'd been living on schedules all of his life, usually set by other people," Prager notes. "He had gone to auditions, to classes, practiced, prepared, rehearsed and performed on cue. He felt like he'd never had a chance to look around and explore what life might have to offer, to explore who he really was."

The tour bus moved him from city to city, a blurring landscape of hotel rooms and theaters. But as they rolled into the Midwest, the destination wasn't just another stage. They were heading to **Chicago**.

In Chicago, the "Theatrical Gypsy" would meet a group of men who were building something entirely new—a "Black Castle" on the shores of Lake Michigan that would change the trajectory of his life forever. The dancer was about to become the artist.
