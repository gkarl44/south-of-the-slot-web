# The Ambush Years: Mellow Men & The Employee Lounge (1975–1980)

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


By the mid-1970s, the scene had shifted again. He found his final sanctuary at **The Ambush**, a bar that opened on Thanksgiving Day (November 22) with a reputation for being "mellow." Operated by "the mellow David, Kerry [Bowman], and Ken [Ferguson]," it lacked the menacing edge of the Tool Box or the psychedelic chaos of the Stud. It was a place to fade.

Chuck’s relationship with the Ambush was a microcosm of his later life. On **March 15**, he was hired as a bartender. By **April 4**—less than three weeks later—he was fired (or quit). The "Existential Saint" was not cut out for the service industry.

But he remained the resident spirit. On **September 21**, the bar hosted a show of his work titled *"Recent Drawings"*. And in the **Employee Lounge**, hidden from the public eye, hung a fragment of his past: a panel from the original *Tool Box* mural, salvaged and enshrined like a religious relic.

Chuck was no longer the "King of South of Market" holding court at the bar. He was becoming a ghost in his own city, captured in candid photos like the one taken by Jim Jann: *"Arnett at urinal at the Ambush"*—a gritty, unposed snapshot of a man who had turned his entire life into public property.
