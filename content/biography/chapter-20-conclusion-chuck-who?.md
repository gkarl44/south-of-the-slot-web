# Conclusion: Chuck Who?

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


For nearly thirty years, Chuck Arnett was a ghost.

The new generation of gay men—the ones who marched in corporate-sponsored Pride parades and married in City Hall—had no idea who he was. "Chuck Who?" became the standard response when his name was mentioned. The murals at *The Tool Box* were long gone, demolished along with the building. The *Stud* murals were painted over or lost. The posters were hidden in private collections.

He was forgotten because he refused to be respectable. He didn't want to be a "role model" for the mainstream; he wanted to be an "Existential Saint" for the outlaws. He was the Toulouse-Lautrec of the leather bars, capturing the fleeting, sweaty, beautiful reality of a subculture before it was sanitized.

But ghosts have a way of returning. In 2014, the GLBT History Museum mounted the exhibition **"Chuck Arnett: His Life / Our Times."** The scattered ashes of his work were gathered up from basements and attics. The detailed checklists of his accessions (Gift 2014-033) were compiled. And for the first time in forty years, the "men in leather" stood tall on the walls again.

Chuck Arnett was the artist of the scene, but he was also its priest. He took the desires of men—desires that society called sick or sinful—and painted them ten feet tall, telling everyone who walked in: *This is beautiful. This is us. This is the Art.*

### Note on the Interviews (1996–2003)

The narrative constructed in this manuscript relies heavily on a series of oral history interviews conducted by Robert Prager between 1996 and 2003. At the time of these recordings, many of the key figures in Arnett's life—including Bill Tellman, Mike Caffee, Don Doody, and Thom Gunn—were still alive and active participants in the project.

It must be noted that these circles were often "peculiarly protective" of Arnett's memory. Prager frequently observed a tension between the desire to celebrate Chuck's work and the need to shield his private life (particularly regarding drug use and sexual practices) from what they feared would be "lurid sensationalism."

In particular, **Bill Tellman**, jokingly referred to in the transcripts as the "Widow Arnett" due to his closeness to the artist, was the primary source for the most intimate biographical details, including the "baby shower" alibi.

Three decades later, this manuscript serves as a historical synthesis of those voices, preserving their specific recollections and idioms ("brevity and circumcision," "potato salad days") exactly as they were shared with Prager. The "Cast of Characters" reflects their relationships as they existed during Arnett's lifetime and at the time of the interviews; many have since passed away.

### Cast of Characters

*   **Arnett, Chuck (1928–1988):** The artist. A former ballet dancer who transformed the visual identity of the San Francisco leather scene. Creator of the *Tool Box* mural and the *Red Star* poster.
*   **Caffee, Mike:** Sculptor and close friend. Creator of the leather-clad *David* statue at *Fe-Be's*. A primary source for Prager on Arnett’s artistic methods and the early "fisting" scene.
*   **Coates, Paul:** Arnett's oldest friend (from 1951). A fellow dancer in New York who later taught dance in Louisiana. He is depicted in several of Arnett's erotic lithographs.
*   **Doody, Don:** First manager of *The Stud*. Worked at *The Tool Box* in 1962 and witnessed Arnett's arrival. A key source for the oral history of the early South of Market scene.
*   **Etienne (Dom Orejudos):** Erotic artist and ballet dancer based in Chicago. Collaborated with Arnett on the *Gold Coast* mural in 1961 and influenced his transition to monumental art.
*   **Gunn, Thom:** Celebrated poet and early Arnett confidante. Met Arnett in the 1960s; famously had his ear pierced by Chuck (using an ice cube and a needle).
*   **Haines, Jack:** Owner of "Bay Gas and Pipe" and early leather bars. Credited with introducing Arnett (and San Francisco) to the practice of fistfucking at his private parties.
*   **LeLuc, Henry:** Manager of *The Stud* who, along with Arnett, went to City Hall to file the permits for the first Folsom Street parade.
*   **Marcus, Mister:** Gossip columnist for the *Bay Area Reporter*. Chronicled "Arnett Week" in 1973 and championed Arnett's work in print.
*   **Ritzenberg, "Kreemah":** A fixture of the "flowery" hippie-drag scene (The Angels of Light) who collided with the leather scene at events like the 1970 Parade.
*   **Tavarossi, Tony:** Manager of *The Tool Box*. Hired Arnett in 1962, effectively launching his career as a bar muralist.
*   **Tellman, Bill:** Arnett’s closest companion in later years, often referred to as the "Widow Arnett." The primary guardian of Arnett's personal history and the source of the "Baby Shower" anecdote.
*   **Wittman, Carl:** Author of "Refugees from Amerika: A Gay Manifesto" (1969). While not a direct associate, his writings provide the ideological framework for Prager's interpretation of Arnett's "Refugee Camp" era.
