# Arnett Week (1973)

In November 1973, San Francisco acknowledged its debt to the artist who had defined its image. It wasn't a museum retrospective or a gallery show; it was something far more appropriate. It was a bar crawl.

Officially dubbed **"Arnett Week,"** the event was a coordinated celebration across the entire South of Market ecosystem, announced to the public in Mister Marcus's "Southern Scandals" column. The itinerary, preserved in Prager's chronology, reads like a Stations of the Cross for the leather community:

*   **Monday, Nov 19**: The Stud. The birthplace of the "Head Bar" aesthetic.
*   **Tuesday, Nov 20**: No Theatre Gallery. A nod to the high-art aspirations of the scene.
*   **Wednesday, Nov 21**: No Name Bar. The "Home of the Elbowriders."
*   **Thursday, Nov 22**: Red Star Saloon.

### The Red Star Saloon and the Barracks

The climax at the **Red Star Saloon** on Thanksgiving Day was significant. Located at **1145 Folsom St**, the Red Star occupied the ground floor of the building that housed **The Barracks** upstairs. It was owned by **Keith Joseph**, a former cab driver who (according to Thom Gunn) had once driven Gunn home.

Prager describes the Red Star Saloon as "the sleaziest bar in the history of Folsom Street"—a badge of honor in this context. For the event, Chuck produced a poster (17" by 22.5") done boldly in black and white. It didn't just advertise a bar; it advertised a lifestyle that had moved from the "Old Homosexuality" of secrecy to the "New Homosexuality" of public, gritty celebration.

### The Opening of The Ambush

That same night—Thanksgiving, November 22, 1973—marked the official opening of **The Ambush** on Harrison Street.

Owned by **Kerry Bowman** (and later associated with Bill Tellman and Ken Fitzharris), The Ambush would become the central hub for the next phase of Chuck's life. If the Tool Box was the energetic, masculine beginning, and the Stud was the psychedelic, communal middle, The Ambush was the "mellow," settled maturity of the scene.

It was here that Chuck would eventually find his "Employee Lounge," a space where the artist—now aging, celebrated, but increasingly isolated—could hold court. "Arnett Week" was his coronation. He was forty-five years old, the "King of South of Market." But coronations often mark the end of an era as much as the beginning.
