# The Tool Box Era

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


The scene is indispensable to the legend: It was October 1962, a weekday afternoon in the dead quiet of the South of Market.

Don Doody was working the day shift behind the bar at **The Tool Box**, located at 399 Fourth Street (some sources say 401 Harrison; it sat on the corner, straddling the line between obscurity and infamy). The bar was empty. Outside, the neighborhood was a gray industrial wasteland of muffler shops, electrical supply warehouses, and print shops. It was "South of the Slot," the unzoned, unpoliced underbelly of San Francisco where the fog seemed to linger a little longer than anywhere else.

The door opened, letting in a slice of the gray daylight, and two men walked in.

Don recognized one of them immediately. It was **Tony Tavarossi**. Tony was a known quantity in the city, a man with connections. Rumor had it he had been sent out from New York City by wealthy backers—silent investors who had sniffed the wind and realized that "Leather" was the next big thing. They wanted to franchise the underground, to take the raw, dangerous energy of the bike clubs and package it into a bar that could sell beer. The Tool Box was their beachhead, the first truly successful leather bar in the city, designed to be rough, masculine, and unapologetic.

But it was the second man, the one trailing behind Tony, who made Don pause.

He was tall, lean, with the distinctive gait of a dancer or a fighter. Don squinted, his mind racing back two years to a chaotic trip to New Orleans for Mardi Gras. He remembered a bar called *Lafitte's-in-Exile*. It had been a madhouse, packed shoulder-to-shoulder with drunks and tourists. But amidst the crush, there was one figure who stood out because he *didn't* stand.

Don remembered a man moving through the crowd entirely on his knees. He padded along the beer-soaked floor, passing from one man to the next, offering oral sex with a silent, terrifying intensity. He never stood up. He never asked for anything in return. He was like a penitent in a cathedral of sin, acting out a ritual of total service.

That man—the man from the floor of *Lafitte's*—was now standing in front of Don at the Tool Box. It was Chuck Arnett.

"He's looking for work," Tony might have said, or perhaps Chuck just looked around the empty, cavernous room and decided it needed something.

What it needed was a mirror. Not glass, but a reflection of the men who were starting to populate this new world. Chuck began to paint.

In 1963, the walls of the Tool Box vanished under his brush, replaced by a monumental panorama of men. These weren't the delicate youths of the art schools; these were giants. They wore leather caps, heavy boots, and denim. They leaned against motorcycles that looked like distinct machines of war. They were stoic, imposing, and undeniably sexual. Some said Chuck had watched Marlon Brando in *The Wild One* a dozen times to get the slump of the shoulders right, channeling that brooding energy into two-dimensional paint.

The mural became the bar's soul. It told the patrons who walked in off the gray streets: *You are not just perverts in a warehouse. You are this. You are powerful.*

Then, on June 26, 1964, the secret was blown wide open.

*Life* Magazine, the omnipresent chronicle of American middle-class existence, published an article titled "Homosexuality in America." It was a watershed moment, a shift from silence to scrutiny. And there, opening the article, was a two-page spread of the Tool Box.

The photo captured the bar in its prime: crowded, smoky, tense with desire. But dominating the frame, looming over the real men, were Chuck Arnett's painted giants.

The caption read: *"A San Francisco bar run for and by homosexuals is crowded with patrons who wear leather jackets, make a show of masculinity, and scorn effeminate members of their world. Mural shows men in leather."*

### Interlude I: The Sculptor’s David

While Chuck was painting the walls, another artist was shaping the room in three dimensions. **Mike Caffee** was a sculptor, a man who combined the classical training of an artist with the rugger desires of the new scene.

If Chuck’s murals provided the backdrop, Caffee provided the totem. His masterpiece was the statue created for **Fe-Be’s**, another seminal leather bar on Folsom. Caffee took a mass-produced garden statue—a cheap, three-foot-high plaster replica of Michelangelo’s *David*—and subjected it to a radical transformation.

Using leather, modeling paste, and paint, Caffee dressed the Renaissance ideal in the gear of the San Francisco underground. He gave David a leather jacket, tight leather pants, motorcycle boots, and a cap. It was a "brilliant Pop Art appropriation," as later critics would call it—a collision of High Renaissance and Low Sleaze.

The *Fe-Be’s* David became the most reproduced piece of gay art of its era. Miniature copies were cast and sold over the bar for $40 or given away as prizes for raffle contests. It was a signal that the "New Homosexuality" wasn't just about sex; it was about creating a new iconography. Just as the Greeks had their gods and the Christians their saints, the leather men of Folsom Street now had their own deity: a leather-clad boy king, standing in **contrapposto**, ready to cruise.
