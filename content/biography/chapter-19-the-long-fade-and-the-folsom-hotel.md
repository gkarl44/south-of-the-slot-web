# The Long Fade and the Folsom Hotel (1980–1988)

The 1980s in South of Market were characterized by a eerie silence. The construction equipment that had provided the soundtrack for the "Refugee Camp" days was quieter now, or perhaps just drowned out by a different kind of demolition. The AIDS pandemic wrecked havoc across the land, leaving the survivors, as Prager writes, as "misfits, loners or pariahs condemned to live in extreme isolation."

### The Final Rooms

The King of South of Market spent these final years not in a palace, but in a series of cheap rooms—often the **Lafayette** or the **Folsom Hotel**. The scene he had helped create was being dismantled by the virus, and the men he had immortalized in his murals were disappearing one by one.

On **July 5, 1984**, the anthropologist **Gayle Rubin** interviewed Chuck and Bill Tellman. It was one of the few times during this period that anyone from the "outside" sought to record his history. By then, the "Just Dealer" was largely surviving on the fringes.

### March 2, 1988

Chuck Arnett died on **March 2, 1988**, just two weeks after his 60th birthday. The chronology notes the time: **12:45 p.m.** He died "peacefully," a small mercy in a decade of agonizing deaths.

Eight days later, on **March 10**, an obituary appeared in the *Bay Area Reporter*. Written by his old friend Don Doody, it was short—barely 75 words—but it captured the essence of the man:

> *"Chuck Arnett, well-known artist and long-time San Franciscan... came to San Francisco in the early 1960s and quickly made an impact on the bar scene with his famous murals at the Tool Box (1964) and then The Stud (1968)... His extraordinary talent and forceful personality left lasting memories to all who were fortunate enough to know him."*

### Ashes and Quilt

There was no state funeral. In April, his ashes were scattered on **Mt. Tamalpais**. But he did have one final parade. On **June 26, 1988**, during the Gay Freedom Day Parade, a panel dedicated to Chuck Arnett was carried down Market Street as part of the AIDS Memorial Quilt.

The man who had defined the "New Homosexuality" with his leather murals was now a patch of fabric in a river of grief.
