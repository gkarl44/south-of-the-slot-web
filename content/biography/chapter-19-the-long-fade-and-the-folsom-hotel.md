# The Long Fade & The Folsom Hotel

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


By the 1980s, the party was over. The AIDS epidemic began its grim harvest, taking the "Founding Fathers" one by one. Chuck, now in his 50s, retreated to a room in the **Folsom Hotel**.

It was a place of exile and memory. Visitors described the room as "stiflingly hot," a claustrophobic box filled with the detritus of a lifetime. Stacks of pornographic magazines towered against the walls—research for drawings that would never be finished. Sketches covered every surface.

Here, Chuck would "hold court," delivering his famous "raps"—manic, brilliant monologues that could last for hours, fueled by crystal and memory. He spoke of the old days, of the "Theology of the Fist," of the saints and sinners he had known. He was a king in exile, ruling over a kingdom of ghosts.

He died on **March 2, 1988**, just weeks after his 60th birthday. The cause was AIDS.

His passing was marked not by a grand parade, but by a quiet obituary in the *Bay Area Reporter*, written by his old friend and sometimes-manager Don Doody. It was, as sculptor Mike Caffee called it, a "masterpiece of brevity and circumcision." It glossed over the chaos and the drugs, noting simply that his "work in recent years has been less public."

His ashes were scattered on Mount Tamalpais, returning the boy from the "deepest part of the deep South" to the California soil.
