# The Stud & The Age of Aquarius Parade (1970)

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


As the 1960s drew to a close, the center of gravity shifted again, this time to a new bar called *The Stud* (opened in 1966). Chuck was there, painting its murals, but the style had evolved.

Gone were the somber, realistic giants of the *Tool Box*. In their place, Chuck unleashed a riot of **Day-Glo**. The *Stud* murals were psychedelic, vibrant, and alive—a direct reflection of the acid-fueled "Summer of Love" crashing into the leather scene. He painted mythical beasts, centaurs in leather, and swirling, hallucinogenic patterns that glowed under blacklight. It was the visual language of the Hippie movement, translated into the dialect of Folsom Street.

But Chuck wanted more than just a bar; he wanted a celebration. He missed the chaotic, permissive joy of his native New Orleans. He missed Mardi Gras.

"He wanted to do something to help to bring that same atmosphere right there to San Francisco," his friend Bill Tellman recalled.

The result was the **Age of Aquarius Parade**, held on Sunday, **August 16, 1970**.

It was announced in *The Advocate* with a brief blurb: *"San Francisco--A group headed by Tavern Guild member Henri Leleu is attempting to organize a gay parade on Folsom Street... The parade is proposed strictly as a festive event without any connection with any other happening."*

The "festive event" was a chaotic masterpiece. Chuck Arnett was the aesthetic director. **Henri Leleu** (Tavern Guild member, reached at AT5-1965) handled the paperwork. **Paul Coates** wrangled the Hare Krishnas.

And somewhere in the background was **Hal Call**, the Mattachine Society leader who dismissed the whole thing as a bunch of "drug-addled hippies." I, in my research, later tracked down Call to get his side of the story. I found the former gay leader in a projection booth, "wearing a dress shirt and tie, but slippers on his feet and a pair of underwear instead of pants"—a fitting image for the Old Guard as the New Wave marched down Folsom Street without them.

The parade was a collision of worlds. Black Sabbath didn't play, but the spirit was there. It was a "refugee camp" on the march, a phrase I borrow from Carl Wittman's manifesto: *"San Francisco is a refugee camp for homosexuals... We came not because it is so great here, but because it was so bad there."*

On that Sunday in August, the refugees danced in the street.

### Interlude II: The Poet’s Saint and "Crystal"

Among the circle of friends who gathered around Chuck Arnett, none looked deeper than **Thom Gunn**. The celebrated English poet, who had "tricked" with Chuck back in 1961, saw something in the artist that went beyond the leather and the drugs.

"Rex didn't mean that Chuck was a Christian saint," Gunn explained to me, referring to another friend's comment. "No halos and without sin. Rex meant that Chuck was an *Existential Saint*."

"Like Saint Genet?" I asked.

"Exactly," Gunn replied.

Gunn immortalized this vision of Chuck in his poem **"Crystal"** (*Collected Poems*, p. 295). Though the subject is unnamed, the description is unmistakable:

> *Now he is Dealer. 52, tall, scarred,*
> *His looks get nobler every year, I find,*
> *Almost heroic.*

The poem describes a man who "has always been extreme," who "puts his soul / Into each role in turn, where he survives / Til it is incarnation more than role." For Gunn, Chuck's descent into dealing speed wasn't a fall from grace; it was just another role, played with the same "nobility" and "honor" that he brought to painting murals or dancing ballet. He was the "Just Dealer," the Existential Saint of Folsom Street.
