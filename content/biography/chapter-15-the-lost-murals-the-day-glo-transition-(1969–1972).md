# The Lost Murals: The Day-Glo transition (1969–1972)

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


Between the closing of the *Tool Box* (which was bulldozed in 1971) and the explosion of 1973, there is a gap in the official record—a "lost period" where Chuck Arnett drifted between coasts, leaving masterpieces in his wake that were destined to be painted over.

In New York, he left his mark on **The Eagle's Nest** on 11th Street, completing a mural for its grand opening on Labor Day weekend, 1970. Like the *Tool Box*, it was a "mirror" of the men in the bar. But unlike his earlier work, this mural contained a "special new conceit." Hidden in the seemingly standard arrangement of leather men was a subtle, almost coded depiction of **fistfucking**.

"Mike Caffee says he could remember how surprised he was the first time he ever saw fistfucking portrayed in art," I noted. "He had a hard time believing that nobody had ever done this before." While Tom of Finland was drawing cops and robbers, Chuck was drawing the "Deepest Part," the first artist to bring the specific, anatomical reality of fisting into public view.

But his most significant "lost" work awaited him back in San Francisco.

When he returned to paint the murals for **The Stud** (1535 Folsom Street), the city had changed. It wasn't the grey, industrial beatnik city of 1962 anymore. It was the era of Haight-Ashbury, LSD, and the "Summer of Love." The leather scene was colliding with the hippie counterculture.

Chuck, always the chameleon, adapted his palette. He abandoned the stark, brooding greys and blacks of the *Tool Box*. For the *Stud*, he picked up **Day-Glo** paints.

The *Stud* mural was a psychedelic explosion. It featured the same rugged, denim-clad men, but they were now illuminated in electric blues, hot pinks, and acid greens. They rode motorcycles that trailed tails of fire like comets. It was "Leather on Acid"—a perfect visual synthesis of the new "Hippie-Leather" hybrid that was taking over Folsom Street. The mural didn't just decorate the bar; it vibrated under the blacklights, turning the dance floor into a hallucinogenic temple of the body.

These works are gone now. The *Eagle's Nest* walls were repainted; the *Stud* moved locations, and the original Day-Glo plaster was lost to the wrecking ball. My notes confirm that *only* the sketches in the archives remain as proof that this "missing link" in gay art history ever existed.
