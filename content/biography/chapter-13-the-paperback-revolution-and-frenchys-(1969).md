# The Paperback Revolution & Frenchy's (1969)

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


While Chuck was redefining the visual landscape of South of Market, a literary revolution was taking place just down the street. The epicenter was **Frenchy's Adult Books**, a porn shop that saw itself as a cultural institution.

In 1969, Frenchy's launched its "Gay Line" of original paperbacks, aiming to capitalize on the exploding market for gay erotica. The inaugural title was a novel called *I Want It All* by a young writer named **Dirk Vanden** (writing under a pseudonym).

Prager was unequivocal in his assessment of this lost classic: *"It should be fairly easy to make a convincing case that Dirk Vanden's 1969 novel, I Want It All, is the single best pulp porn novel ever written that is set in the city of San Francisco."*

The novel captured the transition that Prager observed in the streets. As the "homophile" movement of the 50s gave way to the "Gay Liberation" of the late 60s, writers like Vanden felt "called upon to invent new kinds of literature that would be more appropriate to the new times." *I Want It All* wasn't just smut; it was a chronicle of the leather scene, the "refugee camp," and the desperate search for connection in a city that was rapidly changing.

Chuck Arnett lived in the world Vanden described. They were two artists—one with a brush, one with a typewriter—documenting the same "Golden Age" before it vanished.
