# The Circuit of Pain and the Just Dealer

By the 1980s, the "King of South of Market" was living a much quieter, more desperate existence. The murals were fading or being painted over. The Golden Age of the Tool Box was a memory. To survive, Chuck Arnett turned to the one currency that always held its value in SOMA: methamphetamine.

### Lautrec in Leather

In February 1976, *Drummer* magazine (Vol. 1, No. 4) published a seminal article titled **"Arnett: Lautrec in Leather."** It was written by **Bob Opel**, the provocateur best known for streaking at the 1974 Academy Awards.

The comparison was apt. Like Toulouse-Lautrec, Chuck was the crippled aristocrat of the underworld, documenting the vices and the vibrancy of a subculture that was slowly killing him. Opel, who ran the **Fey Way Studios**, recognized Chuck's genius early on. He included Chuck in the first Tom of Finland art show at his gallery on February 4, 1978—a gathering that included Tom of Finland, Sam Steward, and Bill Tellman.

But the eulogist would die before the subject. On July 8, 1979, Bob Opel was murdered in his own gallery. Chuck Arnett would survive him by nearly a decade, drifting further into the shadows.

### The Just Dealer

Prager refers to this period as "The Circuit of Pain." It was a cycle of addiction, poverty, and physical deterioration. But even here, Prager argues, Chuck maintained a code of honor. He became the "Just Dealer"—a man who sold honest weight, didn't cut his product with poison, and treated his customers with the same respect he had once shown his art patrons.

The reality, however, was often grim.

In one harrowing anecdote preserved in the archive, a friend recalls visiting a hospital on Christmas morning. He walked into the ward expecting a somber scene, only to find Chuck **"dealing speed right out of his hospital bed."** The relentless commerce of addiction didn't stop for holidays, or for health crises.

He was a dealer, yes. But he was also a survivor, navigating a world that was becoming increasingly dangerous. The "Just Dealer" was perhaps his final role—a way to maintain agency in a life that was spiraling out of control.
