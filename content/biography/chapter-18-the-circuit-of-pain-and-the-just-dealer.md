# The Circuit of Pain & The Just Dealer

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


But fame in the underground is a currency that devalues quickly. As the 1970s wore on, the scene began to shift. The "Castros Clones"—men in various states of standardized masculine drag—began to replace the freaks and individualists of the earlier era. But Chuck Arnett remained true to his own dark compass.

He found his sanctuary in the harder clubs—**The Barracks**, **The Ambush**, and the fisting clubs like **The Catacombs**. Here, he wasn't just an artist; he was a participant and a provider.

Chuck’s drug use had evolved from the "Upper" days of the 60s into a full-blown relationship with crystal methamphetamine. He became a dealer, but in true Arnett fashion, he defied the stereotype. He wasn’t a predator; he was, in the words of his friend David, "The Just Dealer."

"Chuck Arnett may have been a speed freak," David recalled at a gathering years later, his voice thick with reverence, "but he wasn't like any other speed freak I ever saw. He never lied and he never stole. If he ever borrowed something from you, you could be sure that you'd get it back in as good condition as when he borrowed it."

The room nodded in agreement. David continued, delivering what I called "The Testimonial": "And if you ever bought drugs from him, you knew that you’d get every penny's worth of what you were paying for. He always had the best speed and he was so generous in his portions... the other dealers didn't really like him very much."

It was a testimonial that his friends would have signed in blood. Even in the depths of his addiction, Chuck maintained a code of honor. He lived his life with the same "brevity and circumcision" that he applied to his art.
