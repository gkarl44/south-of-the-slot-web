# The Saint in the Swamp

He was raised in New Orleans specifically by his mother, Hazel, and his maternal grandmother, **Mary Florence Rohmer**. 

If the Arnett name carried the stain of the "Bastard of Bogalusa," the Rohmer line offered a counter-narrative of respectability. Mary Florence was the daughter of a doctor from Mobile County, Alabama, and family lore whispered of "noble blood" flowing through their veins. But in the 1930s, nobility didn't pay the rent. They were poor in the "keep your nose to the grindstone" sense, living in a house where every penny had to be counted and there was never enough left over for luxuries.

Chuck grew up in the same house his mother had been raised in, immersed in the heavy, incense-laden atmosphere of **Roman Catholicism**. It was a life of "fish on Fridays" and learning to go to confession before mass, whispering sins into the darkness of a tiny confessional booth.

He was taught by black-and-white robed nuns, strict and demanding as they were loving, running the whole gamut from Sister Agnes to Sister Pena. These nuns taught him the difference between moral and temporal sins. They drilled him on the sacred Trinity—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost—and the Virgin Mary.

This education in suffering and redemption—in the power of symbols and the worship of the broken body—would stay with him long after he traded the pew for the leather bar.

New Orleans itself was a tutor: a city of masks, of Mardi Gras parades, of public spectacle concealing private desire. The "Deepest Part of the Deep South" was the starting line, not the finish.
