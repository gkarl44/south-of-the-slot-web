# The Saint in the Swamp

He was raised in New Orleans by his mother and grandmother, immersed in the heavy, incense-laden atmosphere of **Roman Catholicism**. 

He was taught by black-and-white robed nuns, strict and demanding as they were loving, running the whole gamut from Sister Agnes to Sister Pena. These nuns taught him the difference between moral and temporal sins. They drilled him on the sacred Trinity—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost—and the Virgin Mary.

This education in iconography—in the power of symbols and the worship of suffering—would stay with him long after he traded the pew for the leather bar.

New Orleans itself was a tutor: a city of masks, of Mardi Gras parades, of public spectacle concealing private desire. The "Deepest Part of the Deep South" was the starting line, not the finish.
