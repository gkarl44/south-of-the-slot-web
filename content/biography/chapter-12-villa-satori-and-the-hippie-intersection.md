# Villa Satori & The Hippie Intersection

> **Note**: This is a draft extracted from the Project V2 Manuscript. It needs to be fleshed out with archive details.


In 1967, the "Summer of Love" descended on San Francisco, and Chuck—never one to stay in a single box—moved right into the heart of it.

He took up residence at **1350 Masonic**, a grand, decaying Victorian house that became known as "Villa Satori." It was a chaotic, creative commune he shared with dancers like Carlos Carvajal and a revolving cast of hippies, artists, and drifters.

Chuck didn't just observe the counterculture; he participated. For the legendary "Human Be-In" in January 1967, he created the "Love is Happening" poster, bringing his graphic sensibility to the flower power movement. The poster was psychedelic, swirling with color, a far cry from the stark blacks and grays of his leather work. It proved his versatility: Chuck could speak Hippie as fluently as he spoke Leather.

But there was a harder edge to this intersection. The drug culture of the scene was shifting. The alcohol and poppers of the early years were being supplanted by LSD and, increasingly, Amphetamines. Chuck, with his boundless energy and need for intensity, began to slide into the role of the "speed freak."

It started as a tool for work—staying up for three days to finish a mural—but it quickly became a lifestyle. He became known for his "rap," the endless, manic monologues fueled by crystal. He was brilliant, exhausting, and impossible to ignore.
