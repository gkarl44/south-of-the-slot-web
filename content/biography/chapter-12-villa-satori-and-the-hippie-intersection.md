# Villa Satori and the Hippie Intersection

In January 1968, Chuck moved into a commune at **1349 Masonic Avenue** in the Upper Haight. They christened it **"Villa Satori."**

It was a strange address for the King of South of Market. SOMA and the Haight were supposed to be enemies—Leather vs. Love Beads, cynicism vs. optimism. But Chuck Arnett never saw the contradiction. Prager famously introduces this chapter by comparing Chuck to other "Southern Rebels" who defied categories.

*"Like Elvis Presley and Janis Joplin,"* Prager writes in Binder 10 (File 16), *"Chuck Arnett originally hails to us from the Deep South. From the very deepest part of the Deep South... Located all the way down the great Mississippi River... the city has always had a reputation for being decadent, promiscuous, and profligate."*

Like Joplin, Chuck brought that Southern decadence into the heart of the Hippie movement. He didn't just tolerate the "flower children"; he joined them.

*"He had put on his boots, his bells, his buttons and his bellbottom jeans to go out on Haight Street on a beautiful sunny summer afternoon,"* Prager writes in a draft titled *No Plans*. *"It was like seeing a miraculous new world that had just been born."*

### The Acid Parties

Villa Satori became a nexus point where these worlds collided. It was here, and at the earlier Pierce Street apartment, that the "Acid" era truly began for the leather crowd.

Thom Gunn vividly recalls the atmosphere in his interview with Prager:
*"This was also the earliest days of acid. It was late 1965 or sometime thereabouts... they would give wonderful outrageous parties—orgies—after-hours—and I remember one time there would have been about 50 people there... The orgies took place in the basement and I heard pissing close to me on the ground. And I said, 'Stop. Stop doing that. This is a house.' And afterwards Chuck said, 'That's OK. Everybody pisses down here.' Ha-ha-ha!"*

This anecdote—of casual depravity mixed with bohemian communal living—defines the "Villa Satori" era. It was a time of blurred lines. Chuck was designing posters for the **Haight Street Free Clinic** (October 1968) by day, and hosting basement orgies by night.

But beneath the "Satori" (Enlightenment) was a darker current. His roommate **Carlos C.** told Prager bluntly in an interview: *"Arnett was already shooting speed at this time."* The energy that drove him to paint, to organize, to bridge the gap between SOMA and Haight, was increasingly chemical.

The "Miraculous New World" had a shadow.
