### Outgoing Email (Gordon Schneemann to Michael C. Oliveira)

**To:** Michael C. Oliveira <mcolivei@usc.edu>
**From:** Gordon Schneemann
**Subject:** Regarding the Robert Prager Collection (Acc2014-033)

Dear Michael,

I am writing regarding the Robert Prager Collection (Acc2014-033). As you know, in 2014 I initiated the original donation, which included boxes and crates of Chuck Arnett’s papers, original paintings, lithographs, and sketches.

For the last decade, those physical works have sat in storage, their context largely locked away in Prager’s chaotic physical and digital files. I have spent this time reconstructing the digital part of Prager’s unfinished work to fix that problem.

I am pleased to inform you that I have completed the "Prager Reconstruction"—a comprehensive manuscript titled "The Life and Times of Chuck Arnett."

**The "Missing Link" to the Art Collection**
This manuscript is not just a biography; it is the narrative provenance for the art you currently hold. It transforms the collection from miscellaneous "gay art" into specific historical documentation. The text references works in the donated collection.

**Reconciling the Collection**
As we move to finalize the context for these works, I realized I am missing the final shipping inventory from 2014. To assist with the identification of specific pieces mentioned in the manuscript, I have located a video walkthrough of Prager’s apartment taken shortly before the accession.

This video clearly documents the collection in situ, showing the art works as Prager lived with them.

I would be happy to share this video file with you. It serves as an excellent visual reference for your cataloging team to verify the condition and completeness of the holdings against the original 2014 accession. Could you concurrently provide me with the current finding aid or inventory list for the art crates? This would allow me to cross-reference the manuscript citations with your specific catalog numbers, ensuring the final text is perfectly aligned with your archives.

**Proposal for Collaboration**
I prepared this "Restored Manuscript" effectively as a finding aid for the Archives. I am ready to donate the digital master to you to ensure the art can be properly cataloged and understood. However, given the unique nature of this reconstruction, I believe it warrants a discussion about public visibility—potentially as a digital monograph or a co-branded release that finally unites the story with the images.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,

Gordon Schneemann
Editor, The Prager Reconstruction

### Incoming Reply (Michael C. Oliveira to Gordon Schneemann)

**From:** Michael C. Oliveira <mcolivei@usc.edu>

It has been some time. I am sorry about the delay in responding. I do not have access to the art database.

My colleague unfortumatly sent me a poor copy. I have requested a better copy of the information.

My colleague returns on Thursday.

### Internal Notes / Strategy

**2026-01-29**:
- **Concern**: The response regarding "no access to the art database" and a "poor copy" is alarming given the collection's significance.
- **Potential Escalation**: If the response remains unsatisfactory after the colleague returns, we may need to apply external pressure or contact higher-level administration at USC/ONE Archives to ensure the collection is safe and accessible.
- **Goal**: Verify the physical safety and inventory status of the Chuck Arnett art crates.
